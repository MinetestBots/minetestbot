# LuantiBot for Discord #
_LuantiBot and it's author(s) are in no way affiliated with the IRC MinetestBot._

Uses NodeJS and `discord.js`.

## Installation ##

```
git clone https://github.com/GreenXenith/minetestbot.git
cd minetestbot
npm install
```

LuantiBot demands a ~~sacrifice~~ `config.json`. See `config.json.example`.

## Usage ##

To use the bot, run `node .` in the bot directory.
I recommend you use a cron job or systemd service

Might be missing `;` everywhere, or have too many.

This used to be written in Lua, but Luvit is garbage.
